# Project Evaluation & Improvement Plan

## Original Human Proposal Query for the project Improvements
can you please chack current codepase and the whole project and evaluate the project. it should be lightweight stock manaement to be run on uvicorn server. it should be simple , user friendly and very quick to useeither using keyboard and mouse or just a touchscreen. Please look for imprvements to the project that can be done and propose these. 
This app manages the parts database, which is main focus. It eases usage of LCSC parts database and works directly with BOMs from the lcsc webpage to easy adding new parts ordered and also looking for parts in te stock with lcsc number of BOM generated by the lcsc webpage.
This app manages storage place in the stock. It has layout of the stock boxes and users can view the storage space and orient there according to the storage map. The storage map has individual boxes and they need to be labeled with containing parts. There neeeds to be systm of choosing which parts are where located, caging the boxes layout, setting up the storage and linking it to the storage map in the app.
Then there is the changelog, wich purpose it so log all changes in the app and when some other user screws up anddeletes something, it can be reverted easily and also can be tracked what was changed.
Another feature is the users and the stock. there are multiple users possible in the app and every user can put items from stock to its cart. te idea is that the users can have unfinished BOMs in the app and other users can do their thing and not deleting the work of other users. Part of the cart is a feature that prints the BOM from the cart and also displays to the user where to find the parts exactly in a wery clear way.

We want to focus on ease of usage of the app, user friendliness, simple and quick usage, eliminate user overhead, users find this easy to use and the app will keep them organised. propose improvements to the ap that will get the app more to the user functionaliy and usage efficiency. Do not implement it yet, propose the improvements.

## Overview
This document summarizes the current state and proposed improvements for the lightweight LCSC stock management app. The focus is on user-friendliness, efficiency, and effective stock and BOM management.

- **Component Relationships:** Link related or compatible alternative components

### 3. BOM & Cart Workflow
- **BOM Import Wizard:** Step-by-step guidance with error checking and validation
- **Enhanced BOM Management:** Save and manage multiple BOMs per project
- **Cart Collaboration:** Share, assign, lock/unlock BOMs between users
- **Guided Picking:** Step-by-step picking route displayed on storage map
- **Component Reservation System:** Reserve components for upcoming projects without removing from stock
- **Print Friendly BOM Output:** Optimized for physical use during picking

### 4. Changelog & Audit
- **Visual Changelog:** Timeline view with filters for users, actions, and components
- **One-click Revert:** With preview of changes to be made
- **User Notifications:** For important changes made by other users
- **Detailed Audit Trail:** Track component lifecycle (purchase date, modifications, usage)

### 5. User Management
- **Role-based Access Control:** Admin, regular user, viewer with appropriate permissions
- **User Activity Dashboard:** Track and analyze user interactions with the system
- **User Preferences:** Save individual workflow preferences and settings

### 6. Performance & Scalability
