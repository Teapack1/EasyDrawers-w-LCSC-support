## What Can EasyDrawers Do For You?

EasyDrawers streamlines the often tedious process of managing electronic parts. Here's a look at its core features:

**1. Find Parts Instantly (Advanced Search & Filter)**

*   Forget digging through boxes. Use the powerful search bar to find components by LCSC Part Number, Manufacturer Part Number (MPN), description, or even specific parameters like resistance or capacitance.
*   Refine your search with filters for component type, branch, stock status, and value ranges (e.g., find all 1kÎ© resistors in stock).

    *(Placeholder: Screenshot of the search interface with filters applied)*

**2. Effortless Stock Updates (LCSC Order Import)**

*   Ordered new parts from LCSC? Simply export your order/cart history as a CSV file from their website.
*   Upload the CSV to EasyDrawers, and it automatically adds new components to your database and updates quantities for existing ones. It intelligently parses descriptions to categorize components based on your configuration.

    ```bash
    # How it works:
    # 1. Export CSV from LCSC website (Cart or Order History)
    # 2. Go to the 'Import' tab in EasyDrawers
    # 3. Select the CSV file
    # 4. Click 'Import LCSC Components'
    ```

**3. Quick BOM Handling (BOM-to-Cart Import)**

*   Have an LCSC BOM file for a project? Upload it directly.
*   EasyDrawers finds the required parts in *your* stock and adds them to your virtual cart, ready for picking. It even tells you which parts from the BOM you don't have in stock.

**4. Your Component Library (Local Database)**

*   EasyDrawers maintains a local database (`components.db`) of all your parts.
*   View details like quantity, price, manufacturer, package type, specifications, and assigned storage location.

**5. Flexible Organization (Customizable Categories)**

*   Components are organized by `Type` (e.g., Resistor, Capacitor) and `Branch` (e.g., Chip Resistor - Surface Mount, Aluminum Electrolytic Capacitors - SMD).
*   **Adding/Editing Categories:** This system is fully defined by the `component_config.json` file. You can easily add new types, branches, or modify existing ones by editing this file directly.

    > **Example:** To add a new "Motors" type with a "Stepper Motors" branch:
    >
    > 1.  Open `component_config.json`.
    > 2.  Add a new section like this (ensure correct JSON formatting, especially commas):
    >     ```json
    >     {
    >         "Resistor": { ... existing resistor config ... },
    >         "Capacitor": { ... existing capacitor config ... },
    >         "Motors": {
    >             "Component Branch": {
    >                 "Stepper Motors": {
    >                     "Parameters": ["Voltage", "Current/Power", "Step Angle"],
    >                     "Storage Place": "" // Assign a default storage place later via the map
    >                 },
    >                 "DC Motors": {
    >                     "Parameters": ["Voltage", "Current/Power"],
    >                     "Storage Place": ""
    >                 }
    >             }
    >         }
    >         // ... other existing types ...
    >     }
    >     ```
    > 3.  Specify the relevant `Parameters` you want to track for components in that branch.
    > 4.  Save the file. The new categories will appear in dropdowns after restarting the app or reloading the page (depending on server configuration).

    *   **Removing Categories:** Simply delete the corresponding section from `component_config.json`.

**6. Manual Component Entry**

*   Add components one by one using a simple form. Fill in the LCSC Part Number, quantity, storage location, and select the appropriate type/branch. Optional fields and specifications can also be added.
*   Fill out specific parameters like resistance, capacitance, and voltage values to make future searches more effective.

**7. Visual Stock Map (Interactive Storage Layout)**

*   Get a visual overview of your physical storage (drawers, shelves, boxes).
*   See which locations are occupied or empty at a glance.
*   **Customize Layout:** Easily set the number of rows, columns, and extra single drawers (like 'U1', 'U2') in the map settings to match your physical setup.
*   **Assign Branches:** `Shift + Click` on a drawer in the map to assign a specific component branch (like "Through Hole Resistors") to that physical location. EasyDrawers helps keep similar parts together!
*   **Find Parts on Map:** Search results can highlight the physical location(s) of the components on the map.
*   Click on any drawer to see a detailed list of its contents.

**8. Team Collaboration (Multi-User Support)**

*   Multiple users (e.g., Ondra, Lukas, Guest) can use the app simultaneously.
*   Each user maintains their own separate "Cart" for collecting components needed for a project or task. This prevents users from interfering with each other's work-in-progress.

**9. Safety Net & History (Changelog)**

*   Every significant action (adding/updating quantity, deleting components, importing CSVs, processing carts) is logged with user details and timestamps.
*   Made a mistake? Most actions (like quantity updates or deletions) can be easily reverted directly from the changelog page.

**10. Database Management (Export, Import, Format)**

*   Need a backup or want to edit data externally? Export the entire component database to a CSV file.
*   Import a previously exported (or compatible) CSV file to replace the entire database.
*   Option to completely format (erase) the database and start fresh.

**11. Use Anywhere (Responsive Design)**

*   The interface adapts for comfortable use on desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.
*   Choose between a detailed table view or a touch-friendly card view for search results.

## Getting Started & Usage

EasyDrawers is designed to be intuitive. Here's a typical workflow:

1.  **Setup:** Install and run the application (see Installation/Deployment below). Choose your user profile.
2.  **Configure Categories:** (Optional) Edit `component_config.json` to match the types of components you stock.
3.  **Populate Database:**
    *   Use the **LCSC Order Import** for bulk additions from past orders.
    *   Add components manually via the **Add Component** tab.
4.  **Organize Storage:**
    *   Go to the **Storage Map**.
    *   Adjust the layout (**Rows/Columns/Extra**) to match your physical storage.
    *   `Shift + Click` on drawers to assign component branches (e.g., assign "B3" to "Multilayer Ceramic Capacitors MLCC - SMD/SMT").
5.  **Find Components:** Use the **Search** tab with filters and keywords.
6.  **Pick Parts for a Project:**
    *   Use the **BOM-to-Cart Import** if you have an LCSC BOM.
    *   Alternatively, search for parts and click the "Add to Cart" button (ðŸ›’) for each required component. Adjust quantities in the cart as needed.
7.  **Withdraw Stock:** Go to your **Cart**, review the items, and click "Get Parts". This deducts the quantities from the main database and logs the transaction. A printable summary is shown.

## Beyond Electronics?

While designed with LCSC electronic components in mind, the core inventory management, categorization, and storage mapping features could be adapted for other types of stock:

*   Craft supplies (beads, yarn types)
*   Mechanical parts (screws, bolts, nuts)
*   Lab consumables
*   Any collection of items needing organization and quantity tracking.

**Adaptation:** The key is modifying `component_config.json`. Define relevant `Types`, `Branches`, and `Parameters` for your specific items. For example, for screws, you might have `Type: Fastener`, `Branch: Machine Screw`, `Parameters: ["Thread Size", "Length", "Head Type", "Material"]`.

## Installation

EasyDrawers is a Python application using the FastAPI framework.

**Prerequisites:**

*   Python 3.10 (recommended)
*   `pip` (Python package installer)

**Steps:**

1.  **Clone or Download:** Get the project files onto your computer.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/my_lcsc_stock.git # Replace with your repo URL
    cd my_lcsc_stock
    ```
    Or download the ZIP and extract it.

2.  **Install Dependencies:** Open a terminal or command prompt in the project directory and run:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    This installs FastAPI, Uvicorn, Pandas, and other necessary libraries.

3.  **Run the App:** Start the development server:
    ```bash
    uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
    ```
    *   `--reload`: Automatically restarts the server when code changes (good for development).
    *   `--host 0.0.0.0`: Makes the app accessible from other devices on your network.
    *   `--port 8000`: Specifies the port number.

4.  **Access:** Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:8000` or `http://<your-computer-ip>:8000`.

## Deployment

Running the app with `uvicorn` as shown above is great for personal use or small teams on a local network. Here are a few ways to deploy it more permanently:

**Method 1: Simple Background Process (Basic)**

*   **Goal:** Keep the `uvicorn` command running even after you close the terminal.
*   **Linux/macOS:** Use `nohup` and `&`:
    ```bash
    nohup uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 &
    ```
    Output will go to `nohup.out`. To stop it, find the process ID (`ps aux | grep uvicorn`) and use `kill <pid>`.
*   **Windows:** Create a simple batch file (`.bat`) with the uvicorn command and run it:
    ```batch
    @echo off
    python -m uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
    ```

**Method 2: Using a Process Manager (Recommended for Stability)**

*   **Goal:** Ensure the app restarts automatically if it crashes.
*   **Tools:** `systemd` (Linux), `supervisor` (Linux/macOS), `pm2` (Node.js based, works well for Python too).
*   **Example (Conceptual `systemd` service file - `/etc/systemd/system/easydrawers.service`):**
    ```ini
    [Unit]
    Description=EasyDrawers Service
    After=network.target

    [Service]
    User=your_user # The user to run the app as
    WorkingDirectory=/path/to/my_lcsc_stock # Absolute path to the project
    ExecStart=/path/to/your/python/venv/bin/uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
    Restart=always

    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target
    ```
    *   You'd then enable and start it: `sudo systemctl enable easydrawers`, `sudo systemctl start easydrawers`.

**Method 3: Containerization (Docker)**

*   **Goal:** Package the app and its dependencies into a portable container.
*   Requires creating a `Dockerfile`. This is more advanced but offers great consistency across environments.
*   Example basic Dockerfile:
    ```dockerfile
    FROM python:3.10-slim
    
    WORKDIR /app
    
    COPY requirements.txt .
    RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
    
    COPY . .
    
    EXPOSE 8000
    
    CMD ["uvicorn", "main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000"]
    ```
    Build and run with: `docker build -t easydrawers .` and `docker run -p 8000:8000 easydrawers`

> **Note:** For production, you might run `uvicorn` behind a web server like Nginx or Caddy for handling HTTPS, load balancing, and serving static files more efficiently.
